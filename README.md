# Data Mining Models with Weka

### Introduction

📊 **Data Mining Models with Weka** is focused on building and evaluating various data mining models using the Weka tool. Weka is a popular open-source machine learning and data mining software that provides a wide range of algorithms for data analysis and modeling.

This aims to explore different data mining techniques, such as classification, regression, clustering, and association rule mining, using datasets available in Weka. The models are trained and evaluated to gain insights into their performance and suitability for different types of data analysis tasks.
